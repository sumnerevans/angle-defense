Create a planning document that describes (a) your testing strategy and (b) your development
strategy. Remember with Clue we had high-level goals such as testing the deal, test making an
accusation, test disproving a suggestion, etc. For the testing strategy, your document should list
the program functionality that you will test, with a brief explanation. For the development
strategy, you should list the major functional aspects of your program and indicate which you plan
to code in Part I and which in Part II. Note that your plans may change... the point of this is
simply to encourage communication. Also, you may merge the testing/development strategies, as long
as it's clear. 

# Testing Strategy
- Test minion advance
- Test tower fire angle (this test would be placing a minion in the fire area of a tower and making
  sure he dies)
- Test board load

# Development Strategy:
## Part I
- Load board
- Place towers
- Minions attack on path

## Part II
- T
